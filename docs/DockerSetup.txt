Docker is used to containerize the application. This means that it can easily run on the cloud.

To create a new Docker image:
    1) Open the terminal in the directory containing a file named "Dockerfile"
    2) Run "docker build -t image-name .", where image-name is any name of your choosing

To run this docker container, open Docker Desktop and locate the image. It should have an option to run.

If you are in a development environment, you likely want the container to update as you make changes to the project.
This is accomplished with nodemon. If nodemon is not installed, enter:
    npm install --save nodemon
