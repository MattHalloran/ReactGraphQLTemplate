REQUIREMENTS: A gmail account, a twilio account

The messaging service (contained in messenger.py) is currently configured to use gmail servers. If you would like to use a different 
service, the script can be modified

To set up the emailing service with your gmail account, you first need to create an app password using this link:
https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
To generate the password, select Other and set the name to something memorable (ex: Website Backend)

Then, you will need to set the following environment variables on the server:
SITE_EMAIL_USERNAME - What you login as (ex: personalaccount@gmail.ccom)
SITE_EMAIL_FROM - Who the recipient thinks the email is from (ex: no-reply@faroutrides.fakesite)
SITE_EMAIL_PASSWORD - The app password generated in the previous step
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID - Can be found at twilio.com/console
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN - Can be found at twilio.com/console

For windows, the environment variables can be set this way:
1) Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment variables
2) Use the 'New' button to add each variable
3) Restart the server/device to make sure the change takes effect

For Mac/Linux, the environment variables can be set this way:
1) Open terminal
2) cd
3) The top of the terminal window should indicate whether it is a bash or zsh terminal.
    If bash, open .bash_profile in an editor of your choice (ex: atom .bash_profile)
    If zsh, open .zshenv in an editor of your choice (ex: atom .zshenv)
    If you are unsure, it is okay to make this change to both files
4) Anywhere in the file, but preferrably at the top, add each environment variable and its value (ex: export SITE_EMAIL_USERNAME="personalaccount@gmail.com")
5) Restart the server/device to make sure the change takes effect
