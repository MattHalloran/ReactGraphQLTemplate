auth.py is an important script for the website's security. By using a secret key, it can verify that a message has not been tampered

To set up the key, you will need to set the following environment variables on the server that the backend will be running on:
COOKIE_SECRET

For windows, the environment variables can be set this way:
1) Control Panel -> System and Security -> System -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment variables
2) Use the 'New' button to add each variable
3) Restart the server/device to make sure the change takes effect

For Mac/Linux, the environment variables can be set this way:
1) Open terminal
2) cd
3) The top of the terminal window should indicate whether it is a bash or zsh terminal.
    If bash, open .bash_profile in an editor of your choice (ex: atom .bash_profile)
    If zsh, open .zshenv in an editor of your choice (ex: atom .zshenv)
    If you are unsure, it is okay to make this change to both files
4) Anywhere in the file, but preferrably at the top, add each environment variable and its value (ex: export AFA_EMAIL_USERNAME="personalaccount@gmail.com")
5) Restart the server/device to make sure the change takes effect
