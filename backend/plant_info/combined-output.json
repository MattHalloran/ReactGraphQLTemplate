Drooping clusters of white flowers bloom before leaves appear, March-April. The flowers are followed by edible, berry-like fruits, which turn purple when ripe. The berries are often used in jams or baked goods. The flowers provide nectar for bees and have special value for native bees. The berries are consumed by a variety of birds and mammals. The leaves turn a beautiful orange-red in the fall. The ornamental bark of mature plants is smooth and gray with longitudinal stripes. This species is very similar to Common Serviceberry; it is distinguished by its smooth, not hairy, leaves and sweeter, juicier berries.

Its showy, white \u201cflowers\u201d (which are actually modified leaves surrounding the tiny, yellow-green, true flowers) appear April-May, offering a valuable nectar source for native bees. The flowers are followed by oval-shaped fruits, which mature to a bright red color in late summer; the fruits are a food source for birds. The green foliage turns a deep reddish-purple in the fall. Flowering Dogwood is a host plant for butterfly and moth larvae (caterpillars), including Spring Azure (Celastrina \u201cladon\u201d). This tree prefers moist, acidic, organic soils and grows best in partly shady areas of the yard. Water during periods of drought and mulch to keep roots moist. Stressed trees are susceptible to a variety of diseases (particularly anthracnose) and insect pests. Use as a specimen tree in small yards, and in woodland or wildlife gardens.", "yards_images": [{"image": "https://www.jerseyyards.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/cornus-florida-d-220x140.jpg", "url":

shrub. Clusters of white flowers appear in late May to early June. Flowers are followed by small, white, berry-like fruits, which attract many species of birds. The fruits are on top of branched, red twigs, which remain showy after the fruits have been consumed by the birds. Gray Dogwood is a host plant for butterfly and moth larvae (caterpillars), including Spring Azure (Celastrina \u201cladon\u201d), and it provides habitat cover and shelter for wildlife. It will tolerate poor and somewhat dry soils. Use in masses in shrub borders, screen plantings, or wildlife gardens. It is also a good choice for rain gardens or the edges of ponds or streams.

which adds color to the winter landscape with bright red, multi-branching stems. Its small, white flowers bloom May-June. The flowers are followed by clusters of white, berry-like fruits, which are attractive to birds. The dark-green leaves turn shades of red, orange, and purple in the fall. Redosier Dogwood is a host plant for butterfly and moth larvae (caterpillars), including Spring Azure (Celastrina \u201cladon\u201d). Native Americans used the wood to make bows, stems to make baskets, and bark to make a natural dye. This shrub will tolerate wet or boggy soil conditions. Use it in shrub borders, as property screens, or along pond or steam banks to prevent soil erosion.", "yards_images": [{"image":

Flowers may continue to bloom throughout the summer. Seed capsules ripen in the fall. Smooth Hydrangea is native to moist woodlands and stream banks. It prefers moist, well-drained soils in part shade, although it tolerates full sun with consistent moisture. Intolerant of drought. This medium to large shrub may die to the ground in cold winters, and can be cut down to the ground to revitalize growth. Blooms occurs on new wood, so it\u2019s best to prune in late winter. Plant as part of a mixed shrub border, within a partly shady woodland edge, or as a backdrop for your perennial garden.

flowering, multi-stemmed deciduous shrub with oak-like, dark green leaves. Large flower clusters bloom May to July; flowers are white turning to pale pink and are good cut or dried. Leaves turn an attractive deep red to purple in the fall. Exfoliating bark provides winter interest. Oak Leaf Hydrangea prefers moist, well-drained organic soil; mulch plants in the summer to keep the roots moist. Use this versatile shrub in mixed shrub borders, foundation plantings, hedges, or woodland gardens.", "yards_images": [{"image":

Tiny, greenish-white flowers blooming June-July are a nectar source for honeybees and butterflies. Common Winterberry is also a host plant for butterfly and moth larvae (caterpillars), such as Henry\u2019s Elfin (Callophrys henrici). Since it is dioecious (separate male and female plants), a male must be in the area to pollinate female plants for fruit production. The long-lasting berries provide winter food for birds. Use in shrub borders and hedges. Common Winterberry is a good choice for wet sites, such as rain gardens and along ponds or streams.", "yards_images": [{"image": "https://www.jerseyyards.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ilex-verticillata-d-220x140.jpg", "url": "https://www.jerseyyards.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ilex-verticillata-d.jpg"}, {"image": "https://www.jerseyyards.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ilex-verticillata-sw-220x140.jpg", "url": "https://www.jerseyyards.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/ilex-verticillata-sw.jpg"}], "plant_type": "Shrub", "jersey_native": true, "bloom_times": ["Late Spring to Early Summer", "Summer"], "bloom_colors": ["Green", "White"], "deer_resistance": "Some", "attracts_pollinators_and_wildlife": ["Bees and Other Pollinators", "Butterflies", "Birds"], "salt_tolerance": "Low to None", "zones": ["6a", "6b", "7a", "7b"], "physiographic_region": "All Regions in NJ", "soil_type": ["Loam", "Organic", "Clay"], "soil_moisture": ["Medium-drained", "Wet"], "soil_ph": ["Acidic", "Slightly Acidic", "Neutral"], "optimal_light": "Full Sun", "light_range": ["Full Sun", "Partial Shade"], "drought_tolerance": "Low", "grown_height": "6 -

It is monoecious; yellow-green male and female flowers bloom separately on the same tree, April-May. Female flowers are followed by \u201cgum balls\u201d \u2014 hard, spherical, pointy seed pods, which house seeds that are an attractive food source for birds and wildlife. The seed pods may be considered unsightly litter by some, but the benefits to wildlife far outweigh this minor nuisance. Sweet Gum trees also provide nesting sites and cover for birds and wildlife. Select its placement carefully, as it is intolerant of alkaline soils and shade. Use it as a specimen tree or shade tree in your yard. It can also be used as a stately street tree; however, clean-up of the gumballs must be managed.", "yards_images": [{"image":

deciduous tree, which offers many benefits for wildlife. White, inconspicuous flowers bloom May-June. It is primarily dioecious, with male and female flowers on separate trees, although trees typically host a few \u201cperfect\u201d flowers. Blackgum offers an excellent nectar source for bees. Fertilized female flowers are followed by edible sour fruits, which provide an important food source for birds and wildlife. It is a host plant for many inconspicuous insects, which provide food for migrating and resident birds. It offers showy, red color in fall. Its medium-high wind resistance and tolerance to flooded and salty conditions makes it a valuable Jersey-Friendly tree for your yard!", "yards_images": [{"image":

bloom May-June. Flowers provide an excellent nectar source for native bees. Drooping clusters of red fruit offer food for birds in the summer. Common Ninebark is valued for its exfoliating (peeling) bark, which reveals layers of reddish-brown inner bark, offering winter interest. This plant tolerates poor soil conditions. Use Common Ninebark in your shrub border, or as a hedge or screen in your yard.", "yards_images": [{"image":

clusters of white to pale-pink flowers with extended stamens bloom mid-May-July.

Swamp Azalea is flood-tolerant, but is intolerant of juglones (chemical in the roots of Black Walnut). Use Swamp Azalea in rain gardens, woodland gardens, shade gardens, and massed in shrub borders.

It features white to pinkish-white flowers, which bloom in May, offering a valuable early nectar source for native bees. The edible fruit ripens June-July, providing food for birds. The berries are used in pies, muffins, and other dishes, and eaten fresh! Highbush Blueberry offers lush green foliage in the summer, and yellow, bronze, orange, or red foliage in fall. Reddish stems offer ornamental value in winter. Plant Highbush Blueberry as a shrub border, in a small garden plot, or in naturalized areas of your yard.", "yards_images": [{"image":

Saltmeadow Cordgrass is highly adaptable to a range of soil conditions. It provides food and cover for aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. You can use Saltmeadow Cordgrass as shoreline protection to control erosion, for dune stabilization, and tidal marsh restoration.
