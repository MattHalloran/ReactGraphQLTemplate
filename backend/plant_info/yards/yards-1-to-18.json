A whorl of leaves grows mid-way down the stalks with additional lush, green leaves growing below. Leaves are deeply cut with pointed lobes, offering texture and beauty within the foliage. The developing fruits appear like small pineapples, cones or are sometimes interpreted to appear like thimbles, giving rise to a common name, Tall Thimbleweed. The ripe fruit opens into white fluff with dark seeds, which persists throughout the winter, offering additional interest in the winter garden. Tall Anemone prefers rich acid soils with high organic matter, either dry or moist. Mature plants show considerable drought tolerance. Prefers partial shade, but grows in full sun and tolerates heavy shade. Native habitat includes woodland edges, meadows and fields. Plant in mass within your native perennial garden, along borders or a wooded edge. Grow from seed sown in fall or early spring. All parts of the plant are poisonous if ingested in large quantities; a characteristic that offers deer resistance.",

The flower nectar is an important food source for bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds; it has special value for native bees. Swamp Milkweed is a host plant for butterfly and moth larvae (caterpillars), including Monarch Butterfly (Danaus plexippus) and Queen (Danaus gilippus). Stems and leaves have a milky sap, which contains cardiac glycosides. When ingested by Monarch butterfly larvae feeding on the leaves, the cardiac glycosides make them (and the adult butterflies) toxic to birds and other predators.

This plant’s nectar is a food source for butterflies, native bees, bumblebees, and honeybees. Common Milkweed is an important nectar source and larval (caterpillar) host plant for Monarch (Danaus plexippus) butterflies. The leaves and stems have a milky sap, which contains cardiac glycosides. When ingested by Monarch butterfly larvae feeding on the leaves, the cardiac glycosides make them (and the adult butterflies) toxic to birds and other predators. Common Milkweed grows well in poor, dry soils. It spreads by self-seeding and rhizomes (underground stems) to form colonies.

Feathery, needle-like leaves grow in whorled patterns around the stem, creating an appealing and unusual texture. Monarch butterflies depend on milkweed species in order for their species to survive. They lay their eggs on the foliage, which is then consumed by the hungry, growing caterpillars. Whorled Milkweed is easily grown in well-drained sandy or clay soils, in full sun or part shade. However, it’s preference is dry, sandy soils and full sun. It is quite drought tolerant once it is estblished. Include Whorled Milkweed in pollinator gardens, meadows, native gardens and naturalized areas. Broadcast seeds in the fall.

Its cup-shaped, magenta flowers start blooming in the spring and continue through the summer and well into the fall. This perennial is a nectar source for bees and a host plant for butterfly and moth larvae (caterpillars), including Gray Hairstreak (Strymon melinus). It grows well in hot, sunny, dry locations. Purple Poppy Mallow is a versatile plant, which fits into both formal and wildflower gardens. Use it in sunny borders and beds, rock gardens, meadows, hanging baskets, or as a cascading plant over walls. Excellent groundcover for covering slopes and steep banks.",

     "description": "This attractive flower has a long bloom period. Deadheading spent flowers encourages continuous blooms. Northern Harebell is easily cultivated and does well in a variety of site conditions including dry-to-moist, sandy, well-drained soil. It does best in moist soil, but tolerates dry soil. It grows in full or partial sun; afternoon dappled shade offers some relief in warmer climates. When starting from seed, patience is required, as it does not flower until after the second year. Individual plants are short-lived but they spread through underground rhizomes and self-seed, thereby maitaining their existence in your garden. Naturally occurs in meadows, fields, rocky outcrops, and sandy stream banks. This relatively short statured perennial will be an attractive addition to your native wildflower garden, partly shady woodland edge, or in a cooler location where delicate plantings are required. Best when planted in large groups. Northern Harebell offers some deer resistance.",

It tolerates both dry and moist soils. Give this large tree plenty of room to grow! Use Pignut Hickory as a tall shade tree in large yards and in parks.",

The gray, “shaggy” bark is broken up into long, thin, peeling plates, adding ornamental interest for all seasons. The medium-green, compound leaves turn a golden color in the fall. This tree is monoecious (separate male and female flowers grow on the same tree); the non-showy flowers bloom April-May. The flowers are followed by edible, hard-shelled nuts, which provide food for birds and other wildlife. People also enjoy eating the nuts. Hickory wood is hard and used in a variety of products, including baseball bats, and also used to smoke and cure meats. Give this large and lovely tree plenty of room to grow!

One-to-two-inch long, hairy, faintly aromatic, green leaves grow in an opposite pattern, intermittantly up the stalk. Leaves are edible and are known to be used as a seasoning or as a tea. A member of the mint family, this plant offers some deer resistance and has good drought tolerance. Wild Basil naturally occurs in open woodlands, meadows and fields, and is suitable for sandy, loamy, well-drained soil in full sun or part shade. It is easy to grow from seed and makes a lovely addition to your native perennial garden, along borders, or in your herb garden. Wild Basil blooms throughout the summer; deadheading encourages additional flowers to grow.",

The nuts were traditionally used by Native Americans to flavor soup. Many mammal and bird species feed on the nuts, including fox, deer, turkey, woodpeckers, and squirrels. The dense, low-growth characteristics of this species provide cover and nesting sites for wildlife. Its fall foliage colors range from yellow to red. Use American Hazelnut in naturalized areas or woodland gardens, where nut debris will not cause “tree litter.” It can also can be used as a screen planting, or in the back of a shrub border.",

Persimmon fruit is a food source for wildlife. This tree is also a host for larvae (caterpillars) of the Luna moth (Actias luna).

Its yellowish-green flowers bloom April-May. Female flowers are followed by edible, triangular-shaped nuts enclosed in a spiny husk. The nuts ripen in the fall and are an important food source for many species of birds and mammals. The tree canopy is a favored nesting and roosting site for birds and wildlife. American Beech is a host plant for butterfly and moth larvae (caterpillars), including Early Hairstreak (Erora laeta). This tree casts a dense shade, useful as a cooling technique for homes. Its shallow root system can make it difficult to grow plants underneath, so avoid planting it near flower beds and vegetable gardens. Give this tree ample space to grow. Use American Beech in large yards or parks.",

Leaves turn a brilliant gold in the fall. Witchhazel oil has traditionally been used in salves for soothing insect bites, burns, and poison ivy rashes.
