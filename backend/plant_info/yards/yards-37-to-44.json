It is dioecious; both male and female plants are needed to produce fruit. This tree has stunning fall foliage in shades of yellow, orange, scarlet, and purple. Sassafras is an important host plant for butterfly and moth larvae (caterpillars), including Spicebush Swallowtail (Papilio troilus), Promethea Silkmoth (Callosamia promethea), and Pale Swallowtail (Papilio eurymedon). The best results for fruit and foliage color are achieved if planted in groups. Use Sassafras in naturalized areas or as a specimen tree.",

Flowers are borne in clusters at the stem-tips, and also sometimes in the axil of the leaves. Fused petals form a hood over the lower lip, which displays a distinct white spot, signaling a landing platform for visiting bees. Dried fruit capsules appear in July-August. Arrow-shaped leaves form a basal rosette, lengthening with the stem’s growth. Helmet Skullcap prefers moist to dry well-drained soil, in partial shade or full sun. A member of the Mint Family, it self-spreads through seed, although seedlings are generally easy to remove from unwanted areas, and easily transplanted. Prune back right after blooms fade to discourage self-seeding. Established plants thrive with little maintenance. Lovely in mixed flower gardens in the front of beds, or along the edge of a pond.

     "description": "The Zinnia genus contains many species with flowers ranging in sizes and colors, including red, yellow, pink, orange, and purple. Zinnia is one of the easiest annuals to grow. Each brightly colored, daisy-like flower blooms on a single, erect stem. The flowers bloom from June to frost and attract many pollinators, including hummingbirds and butterflies. They also make excellent fresh-cut flowers. This annual will re-seed itself for next season. It is susceptible to powdery mildew; minimize overhead watering and wetting leaves to avoid this disease. Use Zinnia in mixed borders, beds, butterfly gardens, and for colorful accents around your yard. Smaller varieties can be used for edging and in containers.",

     "description": "Yellow umbels of flowers bloom in late spring, providing a welcome source of nectar for bees and other pollinators. Although it prefers sun and moist loamy soil, this tenacious plant tolerates both wet and dry conditions, rich and poor soil, and sun and shade. The sprawling flowers on this relatively low-growing herbaceous perennial create a spreading mass of green and yellow texture in your spring garden. Golden Alexanders will colonize through self-seeding, filling-in gaps where soil is bare. Once the flowers die-back, the green leaves persist throughout the growing season. The leaves and seeds turn a pleasant purple color in the fall. Plant this easy-to-grow flower in your native garden, along woodland edges, in meadows, or wild areas in your yard.",
