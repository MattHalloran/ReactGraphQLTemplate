Although it prefers sun and moist loamy soil, this tenacious plant tolerates both wet and dry conditions, rich and poor soil, and sun and shade. The sprawling flowers on this relatively low-growing herbaceous perennial create a spreading mass of green and yellow texture in your spring garden. Golden Alexanders will colonize through self-seeding, filling-in gaps where soil is bare. Once the flowers die-back, the green leaves persist throughout the growing season. The leaves and seeds turn a pleasant purple color in the fall. Plant this easy-to-grow flower in your native garden, along woodland edges, in meadows, or wild areas in your yard.", "images": [{"image": "https://www.jerseyyards.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Zizia-aurea-d-220x140.jpg", "url": "https://www.jerseyyards.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Zizia-aurea-d.jpg"}, {"image": "https://www.jerseyyards.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Zizia-aurea-sw-220x140.jpg", "url": "https://www.jerseyyards.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Zizia-aurea-sw-1200x900.jpg"}], "plant_type": ["Flower", "Perennial"], "jersey_native": "Yes", "bloom_times": ["Spring", "Late Spring to Early Summer"], "bloom_colors": "Yellow", "deer_resistance": "Some", "attracts_pollinators_and_wildlife": ["Bees and Other Pollinators", "Butterflies"], "salt_tolerance": "Medium", "zones": ["6a", "6b", "7a", "7b"], "physiographic_region": "All Regions in NJ", "soil_type": ["Loam", "Organic", "Sandy", "Clay"], "soil_moisture": ["Well-drained", "Medium-drained", "Wet"], "soil_ph": ["Slightly Acidic", "Neutral", "Slightly Alkaline", "Alkaline"], "optimal_light": "Full Sun", "light_range": ["Full Sun", "Partial Shade", "Shade"], "drought_tolerance": "High", "grown_height": "1 - 2.5 ft", "grown_spread": "1 - 2.5 ft", "growth_rate": "Fast"}]
