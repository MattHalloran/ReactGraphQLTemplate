     "description": "Shrubby St. John’s Wort is a small, rounded, multi-branched shrub adorned with clusters of 3-7 bright yellow flowers that bloom June-August. The fruit is a dry capsule that persists until the following spring. Blue-green fine-textured foliage turns yellow-green in fall. The leaves contain the toxic chemical hypericin, which deters deer browse. As the shrub matures, the older woody stems turn an attractive reddish-brown color and begin to exfoliate, offering interest in the winter garden. Native to dry meadows, fields, rocky bluffs, and rocky stream banks, Shrubby St. John’s Wort tolerates a range of soil textures, soil moisture, and soil pH. It tolerates drought, as well as flooding. This easy-to-grow, low maintenance shrub can be planted as a deciduous hedge, as a specimen plant in rain gardens, or for erosion control. It thrives in full sun or part shade, and is visited by a variety of pollinators. The flowers bloom on new growth, so prune in early spring before the buds are formed. Companion plants include Aster oblongifolius, Monarda fistulosa, or Rudbeckia hirta.",

It sends up a single infertile stalk with one leaf and no accompanying flowers, as well as a single fertile stalk with 2 leaves. Tiny fragrant white flowers are borne in clusters atop this fertile stalk. Canada Mayflower is a woodland plant that stands only 6 inches tall. By late summer, small berries replace the flowers. Canada Mayflower prefers part shade but tolerates full shade, and prefers acidic, moist, sandy soil. Grow your own Canada Mayflower in your shady garden, in natural areas, or along woodland edges. It makes an excellent ground cover due to its extensive creeping rhizomes that aid in its spread.",
