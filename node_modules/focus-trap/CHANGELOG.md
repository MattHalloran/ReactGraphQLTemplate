# Changelog

## 6.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 694e2fa: Package main/module entries no longer point to minified bundles.

## 6.0.0

- Add boolean value support for `allowOutsideClick` option.
- New `preventScroll` feature to _prevent_ scrolling to the element getting focus if not in the viewport.
- Changed code formatting to use dangling commas where ES5 supports them.
- **BREAKING**: Updated [tabbable](https://github.com/focus-trap/tabbable/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#500) dependency to the new 5.0.0 release which contains breaking changes to its `isTabbableRadio()` internal function.
- Help with tree shaking by having `package.json` state `sideEffects: false` to mark this module as having no side effects as a result of merely importing it.
- **BREAKING**: This `package.json`'s "main" no longer points to `./index.js` in the package (although it still points to a CJS module, so it's possible this actually doesn't break anything). It now has:
  - "main": `dist/focus-trap.min.js` (the CJS bundle)
  - "module": `dist/focus-trap.esm.min.js` (the **new ESM bundle**)
  - the UMD is `dist/focus-trap.umd.min.js` if needed (convenient for loading directly in an older browser that doesn't support ESM)
  - **NOTE:** The CJS build no longer provides a function as a default export. Use `const { createFocusTrap } = require('focus-trap');` to get the function from before.
  - **NOTE:** The ESM build does not provide a default export. Use `import { createFocusTrap } from 'focus-trap';` to import the module.
- **New ESM Build**: Included in `dist/focus-trap.esm.*`.
- New UMD Build: Included in `dist/focus-trap.umd.*`.

## 5.1.0

- Add `setReturnFocus` option that allows you to set which element receives focus when the trap closes.

## 5.0.2

- Add `allowOutsideClick` option that allows you to pass a click event through, even when `clickOutsideDeactivates` is `false`.

## 5.0.0

- Update Tabbable to improve performance (see [Tabbable's changelog](https://github.com/davidtheclark/tabbable/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)).
- **Breaking (kind of):** if the `onActivate` callback changes the list of tabbable nodes and the `initialFocus` option is not used, the initial focus will still go to the first element present before the callback.
- Improve performance of activating a trap.
- Register document-level event listeners as active (`passive: false`).

## 4.0.2

- Fix reference to root element that caused errors within Shadow DOM.

(Release 4.0.1 was a mistake, containing no changes.)

## 4.0.0

- **Breaking (kind of):** Focus trap now manages a queue of traps, so when a trap is paused because another trap activates, it will be unpaused when that other trap deactivates. If Trap A was automatically _paused_ because Trap B activated (existing behavior), when Trap B is deactivated Trap A will be automatically _unpaused_ (new behavior).

## 3.0.0

- **Breaking (kind of):** Update Tabbable to detect more elements and be more careful with radio buttons (see [Tabbable's changelog](https://github.com/davidtheclark/tabbable/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)).
- **Breaking (kind of):** If `clickOutsideDeactivates` and `returnFocusOnDeactivate` are both `true`, focus will be returned to the pre-trap element only if the clicked element is not focusable.

## 2.4.6

- Add slight delay before moving focus to the first element in the trap. This should prevent an occasional bug caused when the first element in the trap will close the trap if it picks up on the event that triggered the trap's opening.

## 2.4.5

- Fix `"main"` field in `package.json`.

## 2.4.4

- Publish UMD build so people can download it from `unpkg.com`.

## 2.4.3

- Fixed: TypeScript signature for `activate` function.

## 2.4.2

- Added: TypeScript declaration file.

## 2.3.1

- Fixed: Activation does not re-focus already-focused node.
- Fixed: Tabbing works as expected when initially focused Node has a negative `tabindex` and is in the middle of other tabbable elements.

## 2.3.0

- Added: `initialFocus` and `fallbackFocus` options can take functions that return DOM nodes.
- Fixed: `pause` and `unpause` cannot accidentally add extra event listeners.

## 2.2.0

- Added/fixed, depending on your perspective: If focus is already inside the focus trap when it is activated, leave focus where it is instead of forcing it to the first tabbable node or `initialFocus`.

## 2.1.0

- Added: `fallbackFocus` option.

## 2.0.2

- Fixed: `clickOutsideDeactivates` no longer triggers deactivation when you click _inside_ the trap.

## 2.0.1

- Fix bug when activating multiple focus traps.

## 2.0.0

- Rewrote the thing, altering the API. Read the new docs please.
- Update `tabbable` to fix handling of traps with changing contents.

## 1.1.1

- Improve `clickOutsideDeactivates` functionality.

## 1.1.0

- Add `clickOutsideDeactivates` option.
- Add `escapeDeactivates` option.

## 1.0.2

- Make sure to `select()` `<input>` elements when they receive focus via tab.

## 1.0.1

- Fix buggy attempts to focus nodes that don't exist.

## 1.0.0

- Initial release.
